# PokeFacts

PokeFacts is a Reddit bot made by the moderators of /r/pokemon
which responds with info about a Pokemon when requested.

It currently runs on the following subreddits: /r/pokemon

## Usage

In your comment or selfposts, use any of the following: 
{NameHere}, <NameHere>, or !NameHere

The name can be that of any Pokemon, item, ability or move.

Please note that the exclamation mark notation does not work
with names containing spaces. So !Mr. Mime, !Life Orb, !Flame Body
etc won't work, but {Mr. Mime}, {Life Orb}, {Flame Body} etc will.

Example comment:

    {Bulbasaur} is pretty cool.

The bot will attempt to correction spelling mistakes, so {Bulbasaur}
and {Bulsaur} will both work.

### Requirements to run

Requires PRAW, Python 3, and psutil. Using the latest versions is recommended.
If you'd like to test it out for yourself, you'll need to configure the
`pokefacts/config.py` and create a `pokefacts/secrets.py` file containing
two variables: `PASSWORD` and `APP_SECRET` which are respectively the reddit
account password and OAuth app secret.

If you'd like to modify the code to use for your own subreddit, the only
files you need to change are `pokefacts/responder.py` and `pokefacts/config.py`.
The rest of the code is pretty general. The `responder.py` file only needs the
`get_response(item, is_last)` function where 'item' is a DataPulls.Item object.

### Testing

Run `python runtests.py` to run the tests. Requires pyflakes and pytest.

    pip install -U pytest
    pip install -U pyflakes

It'll run all test files in the `tests/` directory in the format of
`test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.
